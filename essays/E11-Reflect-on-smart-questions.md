<H1><u>Only</u> Smart Questions Allowed!</H1>

After reading the article <a href = "http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to Ask Questions The Smart Way </a> asking questions was seen differently. I personally feel that nowadays a lot of people are extremely lazy and want the answer or result without putting even the littlest of effort into solving the problem. This causes a problem in society because if people are catered to this behavior those people will not understand how to achieve the solution by themselves. Here is an example of a not so smart question: <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9864267/loading-image-resource">Not so smart question</a>. If you look at this question, the title is unclear and it is obvious that the person did not do their own research. Also, there is no greeting or welcoming message towards the end making it seems like the person asking the question is demanding an answer. 

Looking at the answer to this question, the person who responded simply corrected the error by making minor fixes in their code. I believe if the person who asked the question spent a little more time and effort they would have been able to solve the problem. On the other hand here is a sincere question from someone who has invested in trying to figure out the problem but genuinely could not figure out the solution: <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37335/how-to-deal-with-java-lang-outofmemoryerror-java-heap-space-error-64mb-heap">Smart question</a>. Looking at this question the person states their problem, the error they are getting, the current version they are running, what exactly they are trying to code, also they provided resources that they viewed. The atmosphere of both questions is completely different. 

Also one question was specific to that persons problem making it only useful for that one person rather than helping the programming community like the other questions did. Nobody is entitled to an answer. Researching the problem, yourself will grant you a better solution and it would also help out the community by not making the question so specific to your problem.
