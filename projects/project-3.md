summary: Summer Internship for 2017
---

The summer of 2017 I was on a quest to find an internship. After a while of searching I finally found one at Hawaiian Telcom Inc. this position had an IT Intern title which was what I wanted. The internship was also paid which is how I got the funds for my computer. Throughout this internship I assisted Hawaiian Telcom with new hardware and troubleshooting. I also learned a lot of knowledge from this opportunity. The internship consisted of a software update to Windows 10, which I honestly did not have much experience with. Some troubleshooting situations I would have to learn on the spot. While at this internship they should us the server room and other crucial rooms for the company to operate in an efficient manner.

We were all responsible about making sure all the hardware got deployed in an efficient manner and time. We tackled each problem as a unit to resolve the issue faster. When it was just the interns alone, we would split up into two groups of two to tackle the big tasks. One group would be responsible for a portion of the task while the other would be responsible for the other portion, making this an efficient way to finish large tasks. 

We also used Ghosting software in order to image the new hard drives that came in the new computers. Throughout this summer I did have great experience and learned a lot not only from the company but from my peers as well. I am happy I was able to assist others while they help me gain knowledge too. Now that I have some experience with Windows 10 I am confident about using that OS on my new computer, I also will apply the knowledge that my peers have provided to me.
