## Meteor 

<p>Meteor has become an internesting experience. It was a new way of integrating all the things I have learned into one application. One of the difficulties that I had with Meteor was setting the actual app up, indexing and preparing the environment. The process took a long time and especially when it ran for the first time. Another difficulty that I encountered was understanding how the Mongo Database and Meteor integrated (auto-publish, subscriptions, etc). Although this was a pain, I do understand why it is used in actual testing purposes instead of development purposes. I found that Meteor did make it easy to identify what variables were not being used and when the variables were not used properly. ESLint had a lot to do with this feature, also the Meteor application itself would color-code words which helped me read code better.</p>
<p>I thought making these applications was awesome. I have made a webpage before but doing it using Semantic UI, JavaScript, and Meteor made it really fascinating. I know look at websites and think how I could make something like that and try to figure it out in my head. Before I didn't really know how to do these type of things using a framework or JavaScript. Learning these tools definetely made it easier. I found it really interesting how the Meteor application and the Mongo Database intereact with eachother. Creating a database and filling it up with records and modifing it was really interesting especially when more information was being added to the records. </p>
