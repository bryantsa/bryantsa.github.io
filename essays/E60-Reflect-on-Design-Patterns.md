<p>A part of the coding experience is the complications and problems the developer will encounter. Luckily people started to get tired of the common problems and they tried to resolve them in order to get things done quicker and a simpler way. This was called Design Pattern, where the complicated common problems can be reused and are dynamic. Developers use design patterns without even knowing, for example singleton pattern is a type of pattern that can be accessed globally. This operates somewhat like a global variable where it can be accessed throughout the project.

  I was required to use the Observer Pattern for this course because it required me to use function within an event class. This helped me when I was using HTML and was a new experience for me. In the past, I have used the MVC model by interacting with databases and user interfaces. I most likely have used more that I am not aware of, many programs and packages are already made simple for developers to have an easier time with, those packages and programs most likely use design patterns. This is a community that helps one another to make a easier and simplier life when developing programs.
