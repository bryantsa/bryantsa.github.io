<H1>CODE WORK FOR ME, NOT ME FOR IT</H1>


Software Engineering will be used forever and it will be used not only in Computer Science but in almost any other category. Software can be very complex and tedious work if the code itself is unorganized and redundant. Engineering the software makes the code more pleasing to the eye because there is now a method behind the code and it is clear and concise on what the code needs to do in order for it to work properly. My interests in software engineering is making the code work for me instead of me working for the code. 

I want to picture in my head what I need to do in order to accomplish something, in other words run mental code beforehand. This would give me a vision of what the goal is, as of right now I can do that to a certain extent but I would like to figure out and plot the majority if not all code in my head. Another interest is how websites certain codes like JavaScript, it implements object oriented programming into a website even if the website is bland, there are endless possibilities of what you could do. 

The kind of skills and experiences I would like to develop is mentally thinking about the code and accomplishing most of it before I start writing the actual code. I would also like to achieve more in the web development side of my skills, JavaScript would definitely contribute to websites and making them fancy looking. I also hope that I can get a little more familiar with HTML and CSS not just JavaScript this way I would have a better foundation on web development. Software engineering will help out with the rest of the languages I will encounter, because like I said this will be in the Computer industry for a life time.
