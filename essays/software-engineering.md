<H1>Creating a Platform for the Future</H1>


<p>Software Engineering is truly a revolutionary concept. It will be used forever and be used in almost every other category. Software can be very complex and tedious work if the code itself is unorganized and redundant. Engineering the software makes the code more pleasing to the eye and it also implements a method behind the code making the code clear and concise on its intended purpose is and how it works. The goal for writing code and using software engineering is making the code work for me instead of me working for the code.</p>
<p>Picturing in my head what I need to do in order to accomplish something, helps me think about what needs to come first and prioritize. I enjoy using this method but I need more practice, I would like to figure out and plot the majority if not all code in my head. Another interest is how websites implement certain codes like JavaScript. JavaScript adds user interaction to the website making it a functional advanced website.</p>
<p>Thinking about the code mentally and accomplishing most of it before actually writing the code would definitely benefit me in the future. Achieving more skills in the web development field would also contribute to creating impressive website. Software engineering will help out with the languages I will encounter in the future and will forever have a place in this industry.</p>
