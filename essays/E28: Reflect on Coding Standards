Coding Standards are helpful but sometimes they are a pain. When reading code, it is very helpful and easy to the eye, you can see where the function ends and where the variables are called. Also, when learning a new program, coding standards can help the developer by preventing confusion or any doubts that might occur throughout the code. I have used coding standards for a while, I once had a T.A. that would refuse to look at my code until my code check style checked. Check style is the coding standard for Java that we used, at first, I did not understand why people would spend time doing this, if the code worked that should be all that matters. 
After a while I decided to try it out and I quickly began to realize why people do it and how it could help me. ESLint reminds me a lot of the check style that I used so personally it is not that bad for me, however there are still some errors that I do not agree with that cause the green arrow to not show up. The errors are not a major issue, my code still works but sometimes itâ€™s just the spacing between a bracket and a function parameters. When reading code, it does help if the developer took the time to write the code in coding standards because it makes the code easier to read.
 If I am developing a small program for testing or just to figure out something, it does get annoying seeing squiggly lines because all I want that program for is for educational reason not to display. Overall, I do like coding standards because they prevent a lot of confusion but I only like coding standards when I am developing a product that is going to be big and others will need to access it.
