summary: My friend asked me and one of my other friends to build a website for him.
---

Over the last few years my friend knew that I was in the Computer Science program. He is an entrepreneur who is trying to reach his goals in the marketing department. He figured a website wouldn't hurt his case and asked me and another friend to build his website for him. Unfortunately during this time I was very unfamiliar about websites languages and how to build one but luckily I had just finished the HTML CSS on <a href = "www.codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a>. I was typing up a rough draft of the code when I realized the website was quite bland, even when I added the CSS to it. There was something that was missing but I couldn't figure it out. Forunately for all of us my other friend helped out by implementing some more code but most importantly JavaScript. Once we ran the code with JavaScript the functions that were not previous working started to work and the website was up to the owners standards.

Prior to this project I did not know much about how websites run. I had little knowledge about domains and the directories for the web. Although the project did take a little time it was well worth it. After accomplishing this project it taught me how domains work, how to set up a website from scratch, also how to display certain information on the website. This was a successful project for all of us, the owner of the website was statisfied with the work that we made and for me and my friend we gained knowledge about how domains and websites work as well as the code for it.
