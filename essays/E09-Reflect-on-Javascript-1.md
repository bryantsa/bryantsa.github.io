<H1>Let me tell you about JavaScript</H1>

JavaScript was a foreign language to me, meaning I have never used the language or really knew how it worked until this course. Once I started to use the language I realized the basics of it was really similar to Java the programming language, which made coding a lot easier because I already knew concepts and foundation. There are some differences in the language for example: declaring variables, for loops having different ways to go through arrays, and printing the results onto a browser console, also the syntax was a little different. Although there are difference the basics and concepts are pretty much the same. Athletic Software Engineering also helps when I do the practice WOD’s.

Athletic software engineering allocates the time where you learn most and pushes that towards the time of the WOD, giving the WOD the most time and ability to learn and capture the content. The practice WOD’s were definitely useful and a good help towards the actual WOD however, when I do the practice WOD’s I realize I still need a little extra help in successfully accomplishing the tasks. The practice WOD did prepare me for the actual WOD but unfortunately, I do not do well under pressure and ended up mixed up the code for my WOD, making the result partially correct. The style of learning the language and concepts are pretty stressful because a lot of it is condensed. However, the readings do help a little but I found that most of the work I would have to put in myself on my time, which would somewhat work out for me.

Overall, I do enjoy JavaScript I find it a little easier than Java. I definitely do not think JavaScript is a bad programming language, just a little confusing at times. Printing to the console is new to me but I am getting familiar with it. I know that JavaScript will be useful for me when I start developing websites and programming, I look forward to getting familiar with the language.
